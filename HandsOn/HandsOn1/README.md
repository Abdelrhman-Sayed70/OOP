# HandsOn1
- Generate a Package with two public classes: Clinic class and Doctor class.
- Doctor class should contain a string for name, that must be constant (final), a string for working_day ( ex: Saturday, Sunday ..etc.), and a static counter to count the number of generated Doctors objects.
- Implement a parametrized constructor that sets the name and working day
- Clinic class should contain (1) a private array of 3 doctors. (2) A function Insert_doctor, that accepts a doctor object and adds it in the array, and also prints the value of the counter after each insertion. (3) A function display_doctors that prints all the doctors names that work on a given day.
- In main generate a Clinic object and scan data of the 3 doctors and display all doctors who works on saturday.
