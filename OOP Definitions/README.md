
## `Class`
Blueprint, Prototype for any object. and the object is an instance of a class

## `Object`
An instance is an executable copy of a class

## `Data Hiding`
A technique used in OOP to hide internal object details [data members] is done using an access modifier private for class attributes 

## OOP Principles
- `Encapsulation`
- `Inheritance`
- `Polymorphism`
- `Abstraction`

## `1.Encapsulation`
- Wrapping and Hiding data & methods in a single unit (class)
- Mechanism of wrapping data (variables). done by
    - Declare class variables/attributes as `private`
    - Provide public get and set methods to `access` and `update` the value of a private variable

## `2.Inheritance`
One class extends the properties & methods of another class (concept of reusability).

## `3.Polymorphism`
The ability of an object to take many forms (allows an object of a class to behave differently in runtime).


## `4.Abstraction`
Hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
