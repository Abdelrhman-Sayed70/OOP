# Polymorphis
**means `many forms` achieved by using:**
- Method Overloading
- Method Overriding


## Method Overloading
- **compile time** polymorphism [static - early binding] polymorphism
- allows the use of the same method with different signatures [parameter list types or numbers]
- increase the reusability of the code
- single action in different wayes

## Method Overriding
- **run time** polymorphism [dynamic or late binding] polymorphism
-
