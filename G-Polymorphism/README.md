# Polymorphis
**means `many forms` achieved by using:**
- Method Overloading
- Method Overriding


## Method Overloading
- **compile time** polymorphism [static - early binding] polymorphism
- allows the use of the same method with different signatures [parameter list types or numbers]
- increase the reusability of the code
- single action in different ways

## Method Overriding
**run time** polymorphism [dynamic or late binding] polymorphism

**`Rules for method overriding`** 
- There must be an inheritance relationship
- Overridden method will be in the sub-class
- The overridden method in the sub-class MUST have the same method signature [name & param list]
