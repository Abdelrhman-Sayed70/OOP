- **`Public`** 	The class is accessible by any other class in the program.
- **`Default`** The class is only accessible by classes in the same package.

## `Attributes` `Methods` `Constructors`
- **`Public`** The code is accessible for *all classes* in the program
- **`Private`** The code is only accessible within the *declared class* [encapsulation principle]
- **`Default`** The code is only accessible in the *same package*.
- **`Protected`** The code is accessible in the *same package* and *subclasses*. 

# Non Access Modifiers

- **`final`** The class cannot be inherited
- **`abstract`** The class cannot be used to create objects (To access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class.)
